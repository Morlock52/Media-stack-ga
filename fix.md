# Fixes and Improvements - Agentic Workflow Verification
**Date:** 2025-12-06
**Status:** VALIDATED

## 1. App Lifecycle Synchronization (FIXED)
**Issue:** Apps added or removed via the CLI (`npm run apps:manage`) were not immediately appearing in the codebase (Wizard/Docs) because the synchronization script was not triggered automatically.
**Fix:** Modified `manage-registry.js` to execute `sync-apps.js` immediately after any `add` or `remove` operation.
**Verification:**
- **Add Test:** Added "Workflow Test" app. Verified it generated `services.ts` and `appData.ts` entries immediately.
- **Remove Test:** Removed "Workflow Test" app. Verified it cleaned up generated files immediately.
- **Agentic Workflow:** The entire process is now atomic. User action -> Registry Update -> Code Generation -> Build Ready.

## 2. GitHub Icon Fetching (ADDED)
**Issue:** Users had to manually find and download icons for new apps.
**Feature:** Added `--github <url>` support to the CLI.
**Functionality:**
- Automatically scans provided GitHub Data for `logo.png`, `logo.svg`, or Organization Avatars.
- Downloads to `public/icons/<id>.png`.
- Links to the app registry entry.
**Status:** Tested with `linuxserver/docker-plex` and successfully fetched the organization avatar.

## 3. Persistent "Ghost" Apps (ADDRESSED)
**Issue:** User reported apps not being removed.
**Cause:** Manual editing of `apps-registry.json` while the VS Code buffer is open can overwrite script changes. Alternatively, manual edits do *not* trigger the sync script if the dev server is not restarted.
**Solution/Improvement:**
- **Strict Mode:** Use the CLI (`npm run apps:manage`) for ALL changes. Do not edit JSON manually unless you plan to restart the server.
- **Recommendation:** Can implement `chokidar` in the future to watch JSON file changes and strict-sync on save.

## 4. UI/UX Fixes (PREVIOUSLY COMPLETED)
- **Wizard Navigation:** Fixed "Next" button visibility on Step 0.
- **React Warnings:** Fixed duplicate key errors in `AppsOverview`.
- **Dynamic Docs:** Refactored `DocsPage` to load new guides dynamically without code changes.

## 5. Known Issues / Future Improvements
- **Browser Automation Limits:** Browser subagent struggles to render the full React app in the headless environment due to route matching latency or port binding issues (often renders blank). Manual verification in real browser recommended for final visual check.
- **Mobile Responsiveness:** Wizard Step 2 grid is dense. Could use better mobile layout.
- **Error Handling:** If `sync-apps.js` fails (e.g., syntax error in registry), the CLI warns but doesn't roll back the JSON change.
